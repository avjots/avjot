## Day 1
The first day of college began with our arrival at the college Gurudwara Sahib from 9 AM to 10 AM. After seeking blessings from Guruji, we had a tea break. Before the start of our new batch in 2024, we were taken to the college auditorium. About 30 minutes later, the host introduced Ms. Harpreet Kaur as the first speaker of the Student Induction Program. She is the Head of the Applied Science department. She did her best to help us feel comfortable in the new college environment and discussed how unity among peers is a powerful tool for solving the problems we may encounter in the future.

The second speaker was our college principal, Dr. Sehijpal Singh. He spoke about the education system and shared his experiences from the time he joined the college to the present day. Finally, we were energized by a speech given by S. Harjinder Dhami. In his address, he spoke about the value of the education we are receiving and encouraged us to look forward to solving problems with the help of technical education. Thus, the first day of the induction program ended with new thoughts and a refreshed mindset.
